                "rubric": "Two methods: (1) Native Bluetooth Gyro Mode — disconnect dongle, pair via Bluetooth, hold Y+HOME for 3 seconds, LED4 stays on. Works for games with native gyro support. (2) Software on-the-fly gyro — connect via Wired or 2.4GHz, open Cosmic Byte software, assign gyro to any button, choose activation mode (Always On / Press to Activate / Toggle), map gyro output to mimic Left or Right joystick. This method makes gyro work as motion-based joystick input in ANY game even without native gyro support.

Analog mode (switch flipped inward) = longer travel, pressure-sensitive gradual input, best for racing and simulation. Digital mode (switch flipped outward) = shorter travel, instant response like a button, best for FPS and competitive games. Customer physically flips the switch — no software or button combo needed."

Factory reset (hold SELECT+L3+R3 simultaneously for 5 seconds while ON): clears ALL custom settings including turbo, macros, RGB, vibration, button swaps, stick modes — re-pairing required.
